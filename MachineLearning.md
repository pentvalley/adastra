The following machine learning methods are supported in Adastra:

  * LDA+MLP: Linear Discriminant Analysis + Multi - Layer Perceptron
  * LDA+SVM: Linear Discriminant Analysis + Support Vector Machines
  * LDA+RBF: Linear Discriminant Analysis + Radial Basis Function
  * LR: Multiclass class Logistic Regression

First three are .NET implementations using open source libraries (check [Programming](Programming.md)) and Logistic Regression is a mix of .NET and [Octave](Octave.md).
